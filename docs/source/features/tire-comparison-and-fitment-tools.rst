Tire Comparison & Fitment Tools
===============================

Understand Changes Before They Happen
-------------------------------------

This set of core features helps users compare original vs new tires, evaluate fitment, and predict effects on speedometer readings or clearance. It ensures accuracy and confidence when making decisions about tire and wheel upgrades.

Key Tools
---------

**Tire Size Calculator**  
Computes detailed specifications for any tire size, including:

- Overall diameter
- Circumference
- Sidewall height
- Revolutions per mile (RPM)

Perfect for calculating fitment impact and gearing ratios.

**Tire Comparison**  
Compare two tire sizes side-by-side and visualize changes in:

- Diameter and sidewall height
- Circumference and RPM
- Speedometer accuracy
- Visual representation of size differences

**Speedometer Correction**  
Calculates how your speedometer reading will change due to different tire diameters. Useful for maintaining speed accuracy after an upgrade.

Example:  
If your original tires show 100 km/h, but new tires increase overall diameter by 2%, your actual speed may be 102 km/h.

**Fitment Checker**  
Estimates compatibility with your vehicle's wheel well. Factors in:

- Offset differences
- Wheel width adjustments
- Use of spacers

Helps avoid rubbing, misalignment, or suspension interference.

**Clearance Simulator**  
Visually models how your new tire/wheel combo will affect:

- Inner clearance (toward suspension/brakes)
- Outer clearance (toward fenders)
- Ground clearance and track width

Use this tool to prevent costly clearance issues before committing to a tire change.
