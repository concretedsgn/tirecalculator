Quick Calculation Tools for Precision Tuning
============================================

Speedy Utilities for Detail-Focused Users
-----------------------------------------

These lightweight tools are designed for quick, precise calculations in performance tuning, suspension setup, or aesthetic adjustments. Whether you're racing, off-roading, or simply upgrading your ride, these tools provide fast answers where exact values matter.

Aspect Ratio Calculator
-----------------------

This tool calculates the aspect ratio from given tire width and sidewall height.

Useful when:

- You have only partial tire size information
- Working with custom tires or rare specs
- Matching aesthetic profiles across different wheel sizes

**Formula used**:
.. code-block:: text

   Aspect Ratio (%) = (Sidewall Height / Tire Width) × 100

Example:
.. code-block:: text

   Width = 225 mm  
   Sidewall Height = 101.25 mm  
   → Aspect Ratio = 45%

Revolutions Per Mile Estimator
------------------------------

Calculate how many times a tire rotates per mile based on its overall diameter.

Ideal for:

- Gearing adjustments
- Odometer/speedometer recalibration
- Performance optimization for track or trail

**Formula used**:
.. code-block:: text

   RPM = (63,360 inches per mile) / (Tire Circumference in inches)

Knowing RPM helps ensure drivetrain compatibility and precise power delivery.
